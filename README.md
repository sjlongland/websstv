# `websstv`: a web-based SSTV transceiver for headless computers

The aim of this project is to develop a SSTV software stack that can be
operated remotely from a web browser running on a portable computer such as a
tablet or smart-phone, whilst itself running on a headless computer such as a
Raspberry Pi or similar connected to a transceiver.

## Components

 * Decoder software: `slowrxd`
 * Encoder software: `pySSTV`
 * Templating engine: Inkscape
